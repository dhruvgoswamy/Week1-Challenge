# Week1-Challenge
First Challenge
For this first challenge I turned the div elements to elements that describe the container. 
I also added alt tags to the images to make the site more accessible.
Next I cleaned up the code to reduce overlap, it was mostly at the end. 
I added a navigatione element to the header so when you click the section it takes you to that part of the website.
